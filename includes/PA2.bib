abstract = {The german-speaking IS community sees itself as a methodological pluralist discipline. With respect to recent debates (e.g. on rigor versus relevance) an exact knowledge of its methodological profile becomes increasingly important. This contribution presents the findings of a content analysis of 300 articles published in the journal WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK in the last ten years. As one result, the study identified six major methods of the german-speaking IS community: argumentative, conceptional and formal deductive research, prototyping, case studies and quantitative cross sectional studies. It could also be shown, that the methodological profile continually changed during the last ten years. The article also compares its findings with the current methodological profile of the anglo-american IS community based on a secondary data analysis.},

abstract = {Businesses are increasingly deploying their services on the web, in the form of web applications, SOAP services, message-based services, and, more recently, REST services. Although the movement towards REST is widely recognized, there is not much concrete information regarding the technical features being used in the field, such as typical data formats, how HTTP verbs are being used, or typical URI structure, just to name a few. In this paper, we go through the Alexa.com top 4000 most popular sites to identify precisely 500 websites claiming to provide a REST web service API. We analyze these 500 APIs for key technical features, degree of compliance with REST architectural principles (e.g., resource addressability), and for adherence to best practices (e.g., API versioning). We observed several trends (e.g., widespread JSON support, software-generated documentation), but, at the same time, high diversity in services, including differences in adherence to best practices, with only 0.8{\%} of services strictly complying with all REST principles. Our results can help practitioners evolve guidelines and standards for designing higher quality services and also understand deficiencies in currently deployed services. Researchers may also benefit from the identification of key research areas, contributing to the deployment of more reliable services.},

abstract = {Quickly and dominantly, REST APIs have spread over the Web and percolated into modern software development practice, especially in the Mobile Internet where they conveniently enable offloading data and computations onto cloud services. We analyze more than 78GB of HTTP traffic collected by Italy's biggest Mobile Internet provider over one full day and study how big the trend is in practice, how it changed the traffic that is generated by applications, and how REST APIs are implemented in practice. The analysis provides insight into the compliance of state-of-the-art APIs with theoretical Web engineering principles and guidelines, knowledge that affects how applications should be developed to be scalable and robust. The perspective is that of the Mobile Internet.},
